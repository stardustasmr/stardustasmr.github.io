                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br><strong>WHY AM I DOING THIS? </strong>After my father died I started to gain weight. I had always had this weird thing where I didn't like or enjoy male attention, unless it was from someone I wanted attention from. As I gained weight, the attention from men started to minimize and I finally started to feel safe. Everytime I would go to lose weight, I would last about a month and then just go, 'oh, I can lose weight anytime' and forget all about it. This is just one example of the many different kinds of energy that could be blocking you from losing weight. You can read a few others below.
<div>
</div><div>Then, last year, when I started energy healing, to release the pain from my father's death, things just began to change. All of a sudden I had stopped drinking coffee and I hadn't even noticed until a week later! I had lost the desire to drink alcohol and cigarettes started to taste like crap! Little did I know that the core energetic trauma I was focusing on releasing was linked to all my vices, so when I <em>released that energy the internal need for those things just disappeared</em>!
</div><div>
</div><div>The top 3 New Year's resolutions are losing weight, exercising and quitting smoking. With all those energy blocks preventing you from success, I don't think it's a coincidence that between 80-92% of New Year's resolutions fail, every year. This year you don't have to be a statistic!
</div><div>
</div><div>Since I had such success without even targeting those aspects, I am now turning my focus to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and I want to invite you to join me! 
</div><div>
</div><div>Keep reading to see some other examples of energy blocks to being healthy and learn more about the program and how you can start to love yourself again.</div></h3>

This program will provide targeted energy healing to release the energy associated with cravings, lack of motivation, over eating, emotional eating, resitance to healthy food, unloving thoughts about yourself and many more!&nbsp;<br><br>This is how the Body Beautiful Program <em>is different</em>. Since I am using <strong>targeted energy healing</strong>, the energy behind your thoughts and beliefs in both your conscious and subconscious minds will be <strong>permanently released and replaced </strong>with a <em>healthy </em>way of thinking and/or feeling.&nbsp;This effectively makes changing your actions <strong>much easier</strong> since the resistance is gone!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
